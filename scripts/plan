ideas. What should be decentralized?
anti-cheat? everyone agrees on anti-cheat code, everyone verifies that anti-cheat code is running
against a given serverdemo.

you can mine df blockchain for dfcoins - use proof-of-stake, or maybe run on eth

what can you buy with dfcoin
- demos that are for sale
- server alone time
- custom models
- private maps

serverdemos?
send key to get serverdemo, user receives it, or even file transfer
